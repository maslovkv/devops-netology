Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:

  + vpc_prod-subnet = {}
  + vpc_prod-zones  = {}

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
